* Dalg

 - [ ] Fix all w-signed warnings

** Random
  - [ ] Polygon (min distance): Implement quad and use to only look at the necessary line segments
  - [ ] Write tests for subset sum
  - [ ] add kattis test for baseball elimination

** Geometry

*** Polygon
  - [ ] Found precision error in LineSegment distance function. 
        Get large precision offset with comparison (1.15, -1.45) == (1, -1.5)
        Error as large as 0.15 which is unacceptable and needs further investigation

*** AABB
   - [ ] Possibly implement comparison in vector to make collision method smaller

*** Vec2d
   - [ ] Implement tests for collinear functions
