 * The closes distance between a line and a point is the tangent to

 * P: point on the line where tangent to the line intersects both P and pt
 * L1(t) = q + t * U
 *
 * A vector X can be written as X = XL + Xort where XL is the part of
 * the vector that is parallel to the line and Xort is the part of X
 * that is orthogonal to the line. Xort is the orthogonal projection
 * onto the line.
 *
 * Since the projection is done onto a vector it will be relative
 * origo. Thus to get the correct point on the line the coordinate
 * system needs to be moved so that origo sits at p0 before the
 * á¹•rojection is calculated. Then the coordinate system needs to be
 * moved back to get the actual position of the point. Luckily the
 * only position that needs changing is that of x:
 *
 * Xt = X - q
 *
 * Then performing the projection:
 * XL   = q + c * u
 * Xort = Xt - XL
 * c = U*Xt / U*U
 *
 * If 0 <= c <= 1 then the point is on the line segment. If it is not
 * then one of the endpoints of the line segment is the closest point to x
 *
 * Then moving the point back:
 * Rt = c * U
 * R = Rt + q
 *
 * Getting the resulting point R
 *
 * x     : The point to measure distance to
 * return: The resulting point R

/*
 * Returns the point where this Line and other intersects If they
 * don't intersect then return point(std::numeric_limits<T>::min())
 *
 * There are three cases, the segments are not intersecting, the
 * segments are intersecting in one point and the segments overlap in
 * multiple points.
 *
 * Given Lines 
 * L1(t) = p + t * U
 * L2(s) = q + s * V
 *
 * If U x V == 0 then the lines are parallel since cross-product
 * between two points is defined as the determinant of said
 * points. The determinant is a measurement of area between the
 * vectors. The only case when there is no area in the square that
 * they form is when they are parallel
 *
 *** Parallel
 *
 * Can check if the lines are overlapping with the following condition
 * (q - p) x U == 0
 *
 * If they are not overlapping then there is no way that the line
 * segmnts could overlap, return {}. If they are we need to determine
 * the line segment that the overlapping creates. This can be done by
 * determining either t or s and thus the start and end point of the
 * new line segment.
 *
 * t0 = (q - p)*U / U*U 
 * t1 = t0 + V*U / V*V 
 *
 * where * is the dot product. Six different cases exist for how the
 * two line segments can be aligned. These cases are handled through
 * min/max statements thus eliminating the need for numerous if
 * statements.
 *
 * Finally p_start and p_end are calculated using t_min and t_max:
 * p_start = p + t_min * U
 * p_end = p + t_max * U
 *
 * if p_start == p_end then the intersection only occurs in one spot
 * and thus the function returns said point only. Otherwise it returns
 * the resulting line segment.
 *
 *** Not parallel
 *
 * The intersection point is defined by the constants t, s that
 * solves the following equation:
 * L1(t) = L2(s) =>
 * p + t * U = q + s * V
 * 
 * We get the constant t on Line L1:
 *t = (q - p) x V / U x V 
 *
 * Then, to be able to check if the intersection is within the
 * limits of both line segments we get the constant s on line
 * L2. This is optimized by reusing calculations from the
 * expression above. This is done by rewriting the expressin as
 * follows:
 * s = (( (p - q) x U ) / V x U => / A x B = -B x A / =>
 * s = ( -(q - p) x U ) / -U x V =>
 * s = ( (q - p) x U ) / U x V
 *
 * Now we can check if the intersection point is on both line
 * segments by checking if s and t are within the interval [0, 1]
 *
 * Then we obtain the actual intersection point from the following:
 * p_inter = p + t * U
 *
 * other : The line to check for intersection with
 * return: The intersection point. If there is non then return point with
 *         std::numeric_limits<T>::min() as its values
